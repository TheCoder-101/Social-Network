AirQuality,Forests,0.45,"The effect of Air Quality on Forest Health: Although healthy forest microclimates are generally resilient to air quality issues, instances of particulate matter and sulfates may impact particular plant species. These air pollutants can enter forests if they are downwind of areas with poor air quality.       The effect of Forest Health on Air Quality: Forests filter out some contaminants from the air as it passes through, resulting in improved air quality in areas immediately around the forest. Forests also capture CO2, acting as a carbon sink."
AirQuality,GreenInfrast,0.275,"The effect of Air Quality on Green Infrastructure: High levels of ground level ozone or particulate matter can affect growth of vegetation in Green Infrastructure, including native plants or trees, and can shorten their life spans.       The effect of Green Infrastructure on Air Quality: When GI projects primarily use native plants or prairie plants, there can be a noticeable improvement in local air quality due to carbon sequestration and filtration. Truly, the amount that GI can impact air quality depends on the scale of the GI."
AirQuality,HabitatLoss,0.5,"The effect of Air Quality on Habitat Loss: Air pollution has the potential to disrupt terrestrial and aquatic habitat by affecting the plant species that are able to survive in a region. Acid rain, although today it is less of an issue, can dramatically reduce aquatic and terrestrial habitat by creating acidic conditions for plants and causing dead zones in lakes.       The effect of Habitat Loss on Air Quality: Loss of habitat, including the loss of vegetation, generally leads to worsened air quality because there is lost air filtration and a lost sink for air pollutants."
AirQuality,Health,0.575,"The effect of Air Quality on Human Health: Air quality issues immensely impact human health. Pregnacies can be impacted, where infant brain development and adolescent lung development are impacted. Adult respiratory conditions becomed worsened with air quality impacts, especially affected are those with asthmatic or cardiovascular conditions. Particulate matter and ozone are primary concerns for human health.        The effect of Human Health on Air Quality: Responses to human health impacts have resulted in federal legislation to improve air quality. Also, healtheier individuals may choose to bike or walk more, leading to less emissions from vehicles."
AirQuality,Invasives,0.125,"The effect of Air Quality on Invasive Species: To a minimal degree, air quality may indirectly allow for invasive plants to spread in systems where natives cannot withstand air pollutants.       The effect of Invasive Species on Air Quality: Should invasive species wipe out native populations of plant species, there could be less air pollution filtration."
AirQuality,LandUse,0.525,"The effect of Air Quality on Land Use: Air quality factors often time enter into land use decisions. Federal air quality standards may restrict certain land uses. Poor local air quality might restrict development in cases of poor health or odor.        The effect of Land Use on Air Quality: Development, especially industrial development, has well-documented adverse effects on air quality from the release of pollutants. Furthermore, suburban sprawl and highways factor into poor air quality."
AirQuality,Nutrients,0.125,"The effect of Air Quality on Nutrient Management: Sulfur dioxides and nitrogen containing compounds in the atmosphere play into the acidity of rain, therefore alter soil acidity. Differential soil acidity can impact phosphorus solubility and nutrient management programs, and in some cases, can contribute to nutrient loss.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Air Quality: Organic nutrients and the transformation of nitrogen compounds into nitrous oxides can be a way in which nutrient applications impact air quality, although this occurs to a lesser extent."
AirQuality,PestsPath,0.275,"The effect of Air Quality on Pests and Pathogensogens: Poor air quality can degrade the health of plants or crops, rendering traditional host plant species more susceptible to invasion by invasive pests or pathogens.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Air Quality: Pests and pathogens that wipe out tree canopies have the potential to *indirectly* negatively influence air quality through a loss of filtration/sequestration."
AirQuality,Recreation,0.625,"The effect of Air Quality on Recreation and Green Space: To a degree, air quality issues affect visitation patterns for green spaces. Especially poor air quality can harm the actual vegetation in a green space.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Air Quality: Green spae areas generally improve air quality due to the filtration abilities of the vegetation."
AirQuality,RestorNatSyst,0.1875,"The effect of Air Quality on Restoration: The air quality benefits that result from restoration projects could be a secondary, not primary, reason to restore a natural system.       The effect of Restoration on Air Quality: Restoration sites do not primarily focus on mitigating air quality issues. However, restored areas do have the potential to improve local air quality and pull out air pollutants."
AirQuality,RisingTemps,0.65,"The effect of Air Quality on Rising Temperatures: Carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) and ozone lead to warming temperatures, and poor air quality from nitrogen, sulfate, and aerosol pollutants can lead to cooling temperatures if sunlight becomes blocked.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Air Quality: Rising temperatures create favorable conditions for the production of ground-level ozone. Rising temperatures cause a need for people to run AC units, which can release air pollutants."
AirQuality,SoilErosion,0.4125,"The effect of Air Quality on Soil Erosion: In extreme cases only, high levels of air pollution can damage plant life, allowing for erosion to occur in areas without root cover.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Air Quality: Erosion of soil can influence the amount of particulate matter in the air. "
AirQuality,StormWater,0.025,"The effect of Air Quality on Stormwater Management: PM2.5 or PM10 can be deposited or settled into stormwater in extreme scenarios, although this effect is less direct.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Air Quality: Stormwater runoff that takes down trees and floods homes can lead to worse air filtration or even indoor air quality issues from molding."
AirQuality,Transportation,0.675,"The effect of Air Quality on Transportation: Poor air quality changes the way people go about their daily lives, including the amount they drive, or whether the choose to ride public transit. More importantly, air quality policies can be designed to filter out air pollution from transportation sources, thereby affecting transportation systems and vehicles.       The effect of Transportation on Air Quality: A significant portion of air quality issues stem fom vehicle emissions."
AirQuality,TreeManagement,0.425,"The effect of Air Quality on Tree Management: Because some species of trees are incompatible with poor air quality, extreme cases of air quality issues can impact urban forests. This is especially true with high ozone levels, as the ozone oxidizes and eats away at tree leaves. Acid rain is no longer much of a threat to vegetation or urban trees.        The effect of Tree Management on Air Quality: Trees in urban areas filter air pollutants, especially particulate matter. Pine trees emit VOCs (volatile organic carbon compounds) which can be a precursor to ozone problems."
AirQuality,VulnerableComms,0.55,"The effect of Air Quality on Vulnerable Communities: Vulnerable populations are historically located downwind of pollutants, which is especially true for people of color in urban areas. These air pollutants cause major health issues for vulnerable populations who are disproportionately exposed. What's more - vulnerable populations often times lack the resources to deal with the problem in terms of health care or political clout.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Air Quality: Vilnerable populations are more likely to contribute to worsened air quality problems because they lack the resources to avoid it. For example, members of vulnerable communities might be more likely to burn their trash, use wood-burning stoves, or drive gas-guzzling cars."
AirQuality,WarmSeason,0.475,"The effect of Air Quality on Warm Season: Certain GHGs, like ozone and CO2, contribute to the changing climate and changing warm season. Moreover, air quality is an issue that is a major driver of political environmental change and positive legislation, which can indirectly impact GHG emissions.       The effect of Warm Season on Air Quality: Increased humidity and daytime temperatures can exacerbate ground-level ozone formation. Precipitation is a strong control over air pollution, therefore the changing warm season climate changes the seasonality of air pollutants."
AirQuality,WaterQuality,0.125,"The effect of Air Quality on Water Quality: Airborne heavy metals and particulates may settle and deposit in waterways. This is a means by which dangerous heavy metal pollutants enter waterways, although is of lesser importance.       The effect of Water Quality on Air Quality: Certain water contaminants or toxins, such as microcystins in HABs, can volatize and enter the air. "
Forests,GreenInfrast,0.2,"The effect of Forest Health on Green Infrastructure: Forests have little impact on Green Infrastructure, since forests are typically thought to occur in more rural areas, while GI are urban designs. In an indirect way, forests can inspire people to create green (GI) in and around their own neighborhoods.       The effect of Green Infrastructure on Forest Health: GI has little effect on forests as they are often not located near one another. "
Forests,HabitatLoss,0.9125,The effect of Forest Health on Habitat Loss: Healthy forests provide an immense amount of habitat. The loss o forests from development leads to the loss of habitat and biodiversity. Healthy forests also promote healthy streams and wetlands.       The effect of Habitat Loss on Forest Health: The loss of habitat and ultimate infringement upon existing habitat is hugely detrimental for forest health as existing forests become fragmented and become more susceptible to impacts.
Forests,Health,0.425,"The effect of Forest Health on Human Health: Healthy forests can improve the physical and mental health of people who breathe cleaner air due to the forest's filtration capabilities, are less affected by climate change due to the forest acting as a carbon sink, and have improved mental health when they are able to access nature (i.e. nature deficit disorder).       The effect of Human Health on Forest Health: Healthy people are more likely to access forests."
Forests,Invasives,0.85,"The effect of Forest Health on Invasive Species: A healthy and diverse forest is better able to fend off invasives. Oftentimes, degraded forests and human activities in forests lead to invasive species thriving. Opened canopies from logging is an invitation for certain invasive plants.        The effect of Invasive Species on Forest Health: Invasive species majorly impact forest health and composition by overwhelming and outcompeting native species and reducing habitat quality for other species. Invasives have an easier time taking hold in forests that are already unhealthy."
Forests,LandUse,0.7,"The effect of Forest Health on Land Use: The existence of a forested area can alter the valuation and possibilities for adjacent land uses, so as to either take advantage of forest resources, or to restrict infringement upon the forested land. Human-wildlife conflicts lead to altered land-use decision-making.       The effect of Land Use on Forest Health: Land uses develop into forests and destroy them and can cause fragmentation of forests. Land uses alter forest hydrology and nutrient flow into the forest. Fragmentation is one of the biggest threats to forest health."
Forests,Nutrients,0.45,"The effect of Forest Health on Nutrient Management: Healthy forests are an essential component for the absorption of nutrients. Forests play a key role in nutrient cycling, but may not always occur in areas where there is excess nutrient runoff from human activities.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Forest Health: Nutrients are not usually applied to forest ecosystems, although it is certainly true that nutrients must be available to forest plants for growth. "
Forests,PestsPath,0.925,"The effect of Forest Health on Pests and Pathogensogens: The type and diversity of a given forest has much to do with its susceptibility to pest and pathogen invasions. An ash forest, for example, is highly susceptible to the Emerald Ash Borer. Weakened trees are generally more susceptible to pests and pathogens.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Forest Health: Invasive pests and pathogens majorly impact forests in that they can cause massive dieoffs and tree mortality, creating unhealthy forests."
Forests,Recreation,1,"The effect of Forest Health on Recreation and Green Space: Forests provide recreational opportunities as a green space, depending on accessibility.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Forest Health: Green space areas can act as a habitat cooridor and provide remedies to forest fragmentation. Green spaces improve public awareness and education about forests, which can go a long way in forest protection."
Forests,RestorNatSyst,0.7,"The effect of Forest Health on Restoration: In cases of degraded forest health, there is more motivation for restoration projects. The composition of forests has much to do with the appropriate restoration practices that can or should be taken, as well as constraints on restoration.       The effect of Restoration on Forest Health: Restoration reduces one of the most pressing forest issues - fragmentation. Restoration can create or improve forests and forest biodiversity."
Forests,RisingTemps,0.575,"The effect of Forest Health on Rising Temperatures: Forests have a noticeable effect on microclimate temperatures due to shading. Globally, forest cover constitutes an effective carbon sink that mitigates temperature rise.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Forest Health: Rising temperatures alter forest phenology (timing), causing some species to green up sooner. Rising temperatures create favorable conditions for invasive species to move into forests at higher latitudes. Increased temperatures increase pest and pathogen pressure on forests. Increased temperatures can make living conditions unsuitable for certain plant species."
Forests,SoilErosion,0.775,"The effect of Forest Health on Soil Erosion: Through tree roots and vegetative cover, forests are major preventers of soil erosion. Unhealthy forests due to logging or tree lost from pests allow for erosion.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Forest Health: Soil erosion can significantly impact forest health as tree growth is hampered and there can be less germination of desirable species. Agricultural erosion may force farmers to log and clear their forested land to convert it to new agricultural land."
Forests,StormWater,0.7,"The effect of Forest Health on Stormwater Management: Forested areas slow down and absorb surface water or stormwater as it passes through. The loss of tree canopy in a forest dampens its ability to slow stormwater.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Forest Health: Stormwater is usually well-handled by healthy forests, despite some blowdown of trees from the most intense stormwater."
Forests,Transportation,0.425,"The effect of Forest Health on Transportation: The presence of forests may restrict transportation planning so as to restrict infringement. Road shading from forests and trees lengthens the lifespan of road pavement.       The effect of Transportation on Forest Health: Transportation infrastructure destroys forest habitat and causes forest fragmentation, in addition to leading to human-wildlife conflicts."
Forests,TreeManagement,0.45,The effect of Forest Health on Tree Management: There are several indirect ways in which forests impact urban forests. Forests can provide a habitat corridor for urban forests or can act as a source of invasives.       The effect of Tree Management on Forest Health: Urban forests create habitat corridors that improve forest functions. Urban forests might also facilitate the spread of invasives or diseases. 
Forests,VulnerableComms,0.45,The effect of Forest Health on Vulnerable Communities: Forests can provide economic opportunities for some vulnerable populations who may choose to exploit forest resources for livelihoods and jobs.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Forest Health: Rural vulnerable populations who extract forest resources may mismanage forests and degrade forest health.
Forests,WarmSeason,0.75,"The effect of Forest Health on Warm Season: Because forests sequester carbon, they can moderate and lessen the impacts of the warm season climate changes. However, forests have a drastic effect on an area's microclimate.       The effect of Warm Season on Forest Health: The changing warm season climate impacts forest species composition, as some native species are highly susceptible to climatic changes. This is a slow, gradual change. Warmer wet seasons can cause some species to flourish, and others to falter. The changing growing season increases invasive species pressures, in addition to increased pest and pathogen pressures. "
Forests,WaterQuality,0.475,The effect of Forest Health on Water Quality: Forests drastically improve the water quality in adjacent streams by providing filtration and restricting the movement of sediment into streams.       The effect of Water Quality on Forest Health: Situations of incredibly poor water quality in a stream could impact forest management BMPs (Best Management Practices) so as to prevent water quality issues.
GreenInfrast,HabitatLoss,0.25,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Habitat Loss: GI directly provides habitat for certain species, but on a small scale. GI also improves aquatic habitat by limiting the pollutants that enter waterways.        The effect of Habitat Loss on Green Infrastructurestst: Without some form of nearby habitat, GI projects may be less successful because there might be a dearth of pollinators or beneficial species, in addition to faster and more stormwater that can be more burdensome for the GI structure."
GreenInfrast,Health,0.575,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Human Health: GI has been shown to improve mental health by allowing people to access nature. GI also can improve community building and social or emotional health. GI also improves water quality in a watershed, improving human health and recreational opportunities.       The effect of Human Health on Green Infrastructurestst: People who are healthy and have their needs met (i.e. Maslow's hierarchy of needs) are more likely to be able to think about improving their home environment by installing GI."
GreenInfrast,Invasives,0.375,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Invasive Species: Other than the removal of invasive plant species on the structure of the GI, the installation and maintenance of GI has little to do with the spread of invasive speices.       The effect of Invasive Species on Green Infrastructurestst: Invasive plant species can make their way into GI projects, although GI is maintained regularly to minimize the risk of invasives."
GreenInfrast,LandUse,0.475,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Land Use: GI can sometimes be a part of land use planning, or can even be necessitated in certain cases. Due to the cost of GI, engineering land uses may become more difficult or more costly.       The effect of Land Use on Green Infrastructurestst: Impervious surfaces resulting from land use development is often times what makes installing GI especially important to control stormwater. The density or type of land use may create opportunity for, or restrict, GI projects."
GreenInfrast,Nutrients,0.3875,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Nutrient Management: The ability of a GI to filter out nutrients depends largely on the type of GI (e.g. green roof, rain garden, filter strip), and its location relative to high nutrient inputs. Largely, GI is able to uptake nutrients into plant biomass.        The effect of Nutrient Management on Green Infrastructurestst: Nutrients indeed have the ability to impact GI projects, mostly in a positive way. Nutrients help GI projects to grow and flourish, but in excess they can dampen the effectiveness of the GI."
GreenInfrast,PestsPath,0.1875,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Pests and Pathogensogens: GI can filter out pathogens that are in stormwater. Rain gardens and green roofs improve biodiversity and resilience in urban ecosystems, improving their ability to fend off pests and pathogens.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Green Infrastructurestst: Pests and pathogens alter plant selection for GI projects, where susceptible plants are avoided."
GreenInfrast,Recreation,0.7125,The effect of Green Infrastructure on Recreation and Green Space: GI can sometimes be considered a green space and provide  opportunities for people to enjoy nature.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Green Infrastructurestst: Green space use by people may impact Green infrastructure if It becomes misused or damaged.
GreenInfrast,RestorNatSyst,0.375,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Restoration: As an engineered system that often occurs at a small scale, GI can positively promote and influence restoration projects by acting as a ""regional greenway"" that benefits and encourages restoration activities and the restored systems themselves.       The effect of Restoration on Green Infrastructurestst: Restoration and Green Infrastructure initiatives can be mutually beneficial if they are co-located. Restoration projects that include invasive species removals can help lower invasive species pressures on nearby GI."
GreenInfrast,RisingTemps,0.4375,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Rising Temperatures: Green Infrastructures limit  urban heat island effects posed by rising temperatures, but have little effect on the globabl phenomenenon of temperature rise due to their small scale.        The effect of Rising Temperatures on Green Infrastructurestst: Rising temperatures create challenges for GI projects as they dictate which plants can be planted and indirectly impact weather patterns that invariably impact the GI structure."
GreenInfrast,SoilErosion,0.8,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Soil Erosion: Well-designed GI projects effectively slow down and intercept stormwater, reducing the speed that stormwater travels at on land. Slower and less stormwater that runs over a land means less erosion. This effect is limited to areas adjacent or downhill of the GI project.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Green Infrastructurestst: Soil erosion can clog GI projects if too much enters the structure. This ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the GI."
GreenInfrast,StormWater,0.75,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Stormwater Management: Although some types of GI have more of an impact on stormwater than do others, a primary purpose for installing GI is to limit stormwater.        The effect of Stormwater Management on Green Infrastructurestst: Stormwater issues are the main reason why GI is installed. Stormwater can carry sediment and pollutants in the GI structures, creating maintenance requirements for the GI. "
GreenInfrast,Transportation,0.675,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Transportation: Green infrastructure has somewhat of an effect on transportation design, as it often occurs along roads or highways. GI can reduce or improve the walkability, bikability, or drivability of a particular street depending on its design and application.       The effect of Transportation on Green Infrastructurestst: Pervious pavements can be used as both a transportation infrastructure and a green infrastructure. Often times, transportation routes can create opportunities for adjacent GI projects."
GreenInfrast,TreeManagement,0.4125,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Tree Management: Some managers of GI projects consider maintaining an urban tree canopy to be a type of green infrastructure. Therefore, GI projects can result in an improved urban tree canopy. However, some GI projects, such as rain gardens, require street tree removal.       The effect of Tree Management on Green Infrastructurestst: In some instances, trees can be used as a green infrastructure. The urban tree canopy intercepts and slows down stormwater."
GreenInfrast,VulnerableComms,0.5625,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Vulnerable Communities: Green Infrastructure alleviates flooding and water quality issues in vulnerable communities to a degree. This depends on the extent of the GI project (size) in vulnerable areas, which often times is minimal to none. In cases where GI does exist in vulnerable communities, it can also serve as a place of healing as a connection to nature.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Green Infrastructurestst: Green infrastructure is difficult to implement in vulnerable communities because they are low income neighborhoods that are less concerned with installing environmentally-beneficial structures than they are with meeting their paychecks."
GreenInfrast,WarmSeason,0.4,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Warm Season: Due to its small scale, GI has little effect on the global phenomenon of the changing warm season climate, although it does have some mitigative microclimate effects on cooling and water retention.       The effect of Warm Season on Green Infrastructurestst: The changing warm season climate and precipitation patterns can spark an increased reliance on GI as an adaptation option. Changes to seasonality can impact the functionality of existing GI designs, potentially by affecting the native plants used for the GI."
GreenInfrast,WaterQuality,0.5375,"The effect of Green Infrastructure on Water Quality: Green Infrastructure, depending on its size, is generally very beneficial for water quality in adjacent streams because the infrastructure filters out pollutants and slows down stormwater before it enters streams.       The effect of Water Quality on Green Infrastructureststst: Water that enters GI infrastructure while carrying pollutants can impact the GI media by clogging the structure, reducing the effectiveness of the GI."
HabitatLoss,Health,0.45,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Human Health: Lost habitat means less access to nature for humans, which can lead to worsened mental health in addition to less opportunities for phyiscal recreation activities like hiking. Lost habitat also generally means worse air quality which can damage the human body.        The effect of Human Health on Habitat Loss: There is an increasing recognition that access to nature improves human health. Therefore, human health initiatives have the ability to promote healthy habitat."
HabitatLoss,Invasives,1,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Invasive Species: Degraded habitat can often times promote invasive species to spread, especially invasive plants. Lost habitat, including open tree canopies, generally promote invasive plant growth in the understory.       The effect of Invasive Species on Habitat Loss: Invasive species, especially invasive plants and pests, directly contribute to the loss of biodiversity and habitat, including a decline in habitat quality. The fruit that comes from invasive plants, for example, offers lower nutritional value for organisms than would native flowering plants."
HabitatLoss,LandUse,0.65,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Land Use: Habitat for endangered or listed species will prevent certain types of land uses if they are thought to negatively impact the species. The loss of habitat on a parcel of land may impact the value of the land in one direction or the other, which alters land use possibilities.       The effect of Land Use on Habitat Loss: Land use directly contributes to habitat loss as development infringes upon undeveloped habitat areas. "
HabitatLoss,Nutrients,0.525,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Nutrient Management: As habitat is lost to development and impervious surfaces, a watershed can be said to be ""lost"" as it becomes more flasky. This flashiness as a result of lost habitat leads to faster and more stormwater runoff, which means that more nutrients are carried into streams.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Habitat Loss: Because nutrients are an essential part of the growth dynamics of streams or forests, they have much to do with habitat health. Nutrients are especially harmful for aquatic habitat due to toxicity (e.g. HABs). "
HabitatLoss,PestsPath,0.6,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Pests and Pathogensogens: A smaller genetic pool of various plant species due to habitat loss and infrigement generally means that the remaining organisms are more susceptible to pest and pathogen outbreaks.        The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Habitat Loss: Invasive pests and pathogens cause habitat loss as forest health is degraded and trees are killed. The loss of a tree canopy worsens the habitat quality for native species like insects, amphibians, and other plants."
HabitatLoss,Recreation,0.95,The effect of Habitat Loss on Recreation and Green Space: The loss of habitat directly limits the potential recreation opportunities that people have in green space areas.        The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Habitat Loss: Green space areas provide habitat for many species. Access and visitation of green spaces can increase advocacy for habitat improvements. 
HabitatLoss,RestorNatSyst,0.8,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Restoration: The loss of habitat or degradation of habitats can be a major driver for restoring a natural system. The degree to which a habitat has been ""lost"" can affect its ability to be restored.       The effect of Restoration on Habitat Loss: Restoration of natural systems directly reduces habitat loss by creating desirable habitat out of nothing."
HabitatLoss,RisingTemps,0.3375,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Rising Temperatures: As habitats are lost, there is less absorption of CO2 (loss of a carbon sink) and less beneficial microclimate cooling effects from shading.        The effect of Rising Temperatures on Habitat Loss: Rising temperatures can change species ranges and degrade habitat slowly over time. Rising temperatures heighten pest and pathogen pressures, which have the potential to degrade or destroy habitat."
HabitatLoss,SoilErosion,0.825,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Soil Erosion: The loss of habitat leads directly to soil erosion as there is less forest cover or vegetation that prevents erosion. Certainly, the infringement upon habitat (the human activities themselves) can be known to cause erosion, including for example the tillage of prairies.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Habitat Loss: Soil erosion leads to habitat loss as vegetation becomes less likely. Sedimentation in rivers cvan harm aqutic habitat, including areas where fish are more likely to spawn."
HabitatLoss,StormWater,0.775,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Stormwater Management: Lost habitat leads to flashier stormwater events, as there is less habitat cover to mitigate and absorb stormwater.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Habitat Loss: Stormwater that causes flooding or that erodes banks can be especially harmful to aquatic and riparian habitat."
HabitatLoss,Transportation,0.575,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Transportation: Transportation infrastructure, in some cases, might not be built in certain areas where there are efforts to curb habitat loss.        The effect of Transportation on Habitat Loss: Transportation infrasturcture chops up habitat, causing fragmentation. This has dramatic effects on wildlife biodiversity."
HabitatLoss,TreeManagement,0.675,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Tree Management: When habitat is lost, there may be more of an effort to plant trees in urban areas to compensate. It is especially important to add urban forestry infrastructure to parcels of land where habitat has been lost.        The effect of Tree Management on Habitat Loss: Urban forests create habitat opportunities for many species, including mammals and insects."
HabitatLoss,VulnerableComms,0.45,The effect of Habitat Loss on Vulnerable Communities: Vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted by lost habitat in that they are especially threatened by the loss of provisioning ecosystem services that are destroyed when habitat is lost. The degree to which this occurs depends on how much a vulnerable population relies upon natural systems for their livelihoods or sustenance.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Habitat Loss: Vulnerable rural populations who rely on forest resources for their livelihoods have the potential to destroy habitat in the process.
HabitatLoss,WarmSeason,0.5375,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Warm Season: The conversion of habitat to infrastructure generally means that there is a smaller carbon sink and a larger carbon source, which contributes to the changing warm season.       The effect of Warm Season on Habitat Loss: The warm season climate changes cause phenological mismatches and changing patterns. Changing clamtic conditions changes the ways in which habitats function. Increased pest, pathogen, and invasive pressures due to a shifting climate leads to the loss of suitable habitat for native species. "
HabitatLoss,WaterQuality,0.7875,"The effect of Habitat Loss on Water Quality: A reduction in habitat equates to less vegetation that is useful to slow down water and pollutants that would enter waterways. Water quality also includes the physical quality of the water (e.g. temperature). The loss of habitat adjacent to streams means there is less shading from trees, leading to warmer waterways.       The effect of Water Quality on Habitat Loss: Water quality has a direct impact on aquatic habitat quality. There is less of an effect of water quality for terrestrial species."
Health,Invasives,0.225,"The effect of Human Health on Invasive Species: To a small degree, individuals in poor health are probably less likely to go out and remove invasives.       The effect of Invasive Species on Human Health: Indirectly, as invasive species degrade and destroy habitat, so too are the provisioning services once provided by the habitat."
Health,LandUse,0.55,"The effect of Human Health on Land Use: Ailments to human health collectively changes the lifestyles of individuals, which may have indirect impacts on land use decision-making.       The effect of Land Use on Human Health: Anything done to the land and put into a landspace will invariable affect the livelihoods of the people who live there, including the air they breathe and the water they drink. "
Health,Nutrients,0.4,"The effect of Human Health on Nutrient Management: To promote human health, people may choose to eat foods that have higher or lower nutrient footprints.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Human Health: Nutrients in foods are important for human nutrition and health. Nutrients in excess in waterways can harm drinking water quality. "
Health,PestsPath,0.5,"The effect of Human Health on Pests and Pathogensogens: Pest and pathogen management is something that is emphasized when it affects human health. Therefore, poor human health leads to pest and pathogen management and control.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Human Health: There are direct and indirect impacts that pests and pathogens have on human health. Of course, pathogens that are human-transmitted have major impacts on human health. Tics that carry Lyme Disease are increasingly threatining to human health. Tree loss and ecosystem degradation due to pests and pathogens threatens physical health (poorer air quality) and mental health (worsened access to nature)."
Health,Recreation,0.7875,"The effect of Human Health on Recreation and Green Space: Depending on how healthy people are, there may be some differences in perception, usage, and design of green spaces.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Human Health: Green space access greatly improves physical and mental health for people who use it. It also can improve community building when people come together to green spaces. "
Health,RestorNatSyst,0.4875,"The effect of Human Health on Restoration: To a degree, people in poor health are less likely to worry about restoring natural systems.       The effect of Restoration on Human Health: Because restoration improves ecosystem services (e.g. air and water quality), human health is improved with a healthier environment."
Health,RisingTemps,0.375,"The effect of Human Health on Rising Temperatures: To a small degree, individuals in poor or good health may have different carbon footprints, affecting rising temperatures.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Human Health: Heat stress caused by rising temperatures, including urban heat island impacts, are highly impactful on human health. Heat stroke and illnesses, premature labor and delivery, infant and elderly health are all caused or worsened during heat stress. Furthermore, pathogens and pests that thrive in rising temperature conditions pose a threat to human health via the spread of disease."
Health,SoilErosion,0.35,"The effect of Human Health on Soil Erosion: Degrading human health may spur improper soil management strategies that cause erosion.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Human Health: Soil erosion can threaten food supply, which ultimately impact human nutrition. Eroded soils carry nutrients into water bodies, causing harmful algal blooms that can be toxic to humans."
Health,StormWater,0.45,The effect of Human Health on Stormwater Management: Human health issues stemming from water quality may be a reason to alleviate stormwater issues.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Human Health: Stormwater runoff across the land leads to poor water quality and drinking water problems.

Health,Transportation,0.625,"The effect of Human Health on Transportation: Healthy and unhealthy individuals utilize transportation in different ways in terms of access, frequency, and type of transportation method.       The effect of Transportation on Human Health: Active transportation methods (walking, biking, running) are ways to improve health. Vehicular transportation causes emissions which contribute to worsened human health from air quality problems and climate impacts on health."
Health,TreeManagement,0.5,"The effect of Human Health on Tree Management: To an extent, citizens concerned about their health may be proponents of urban forests.       The effect of Tree Management on Human Health: Urban trees improve physical and mental health by cleaning the air, cooling an area, and offering green spaces for people to access."
Health,VulnerableComms,0.7,"The effect of Human Health on Vulnerable Communities: People who are healthy are better able to understand their own vulnerabilities and are primed to improve the situation for vulnerable populations.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Human Health: By being in a Vulnerable population, a person is disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards and is less likely to be able to access proper medical care in these instances. Marginalized communities therefore bear the burden of climate and environmental health impacts."
Health,WarmSeason,0.575,"The effect of Human Health on Warm Season: People who are healthy have a greater ability to lower their emissions.       The effect of Warm Season on Human Health: The changing warm season climate exacerbates ground-level ozone, which increases cardiovascular problems for people. Flooding events are more likely, which can harm human health and livelihoods. An increase in allergens, diseases, and pests due to a changing climate can lead to problems for human health. Growing season changes have the potential to disrupt food systems, jeopardizing human nutrition."
Health,WaterQuality,0.525,"The effect of Human Health on Water Quality: People in poor health may have less ability to lessen their impact on water quality and may use products that harm water quality.       The effect of Water Quality on Human Health: Water quality has an immense impact on human health; drinking water is essential to life. Damaged water quality from a myriad of causes can be deadly, or lead to chronic health problems."
Invasives,LandUse,0.675,The effect of Invasive Species on Land Use: The threat of invasive species can be a part of land use planning or not - resulting in invasives being neutralized or simply ignored by various types of land uses.       The effect of Land Use on Invasive Species: Poorly managed land uses allow for invasive species to take hold as native habitat is opened up or encroached upon by humans.
Invasives,Nutrients,0.525,The effect of Invasive Species on Nutrient Management: Invasive plants have the ability to uptake nutrients that are in the soil. Invasives that cause the death of native plants lead to the release of nutrients back into the soil/watershed following massive die-offs.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Invasive Species: Nutrients can be used to by invasive plants to fuel their growth. Certain invasive species are adaptable to changing conditions posed by nutrient influxes.
Invasives,PestsPath,0.7625,"The effect of Invasive Species on Pests and Pathogensogens: As the host species changes (i.e. as invasive plants alter community composition in an ecosystem), the composition of pests and pathogens also changes. Pests are oftentimes invasive themselves.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Invasive Species: Pests and pathogens can either be endemic to an area, or invasive. Those that are invasive are the ones that are dangerous to a system. Invasive pests and pathogens that change a microenvironment due to tree loss might open up space for invasive plants to come in. Some pathogens actually keep invasive organism populations in check."
Invasives,Recreation,0.9625,"The effect of Invasive Species on Recreation and Green Space: Invasives have the ability to turn green spaces into monocultures. Invasives, therefore, are important to be managed in recreational areas. Invasives impact nature experiences and can affect the quality of recreational opportunities, including fishing and wildflower recreating.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Invasive Species: Green space management typically involves invasive species removal. Conversely, the use of green space areas by visitors might facilitate the spread of invasive plants or insects by way of ""hitchhiking""."

The effect of Restoration on Invasive Species: A major component of restoration projects is the removal of invasive species. A quality restored system is resilient to invasions "
Invasives,RisingTemps,0.3,"The effect of Invasive Species on Rising Temperatures: Invasive species in general have little effect on rising temperatures. If invasive pests, like the Emerald Ash Borer, manage to devastate entire stands of trees, it can cause a carbon sink to turn into a carbon source.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Invasive Species: Rising temperatures influence species ranges by promoting a northward shift in range for many invaders. Native species are susceptible to invasions because they are weakened from living in temperature extremes they are not yet adapted to handle."
Invasives,SoilErosion,0.65,"The effect of Invasive Species on Soil Erosion: Depending on the type of invasive species, certain invasive plants can reduce erosion via their roots, while other invasive plants have a worse grip on the soil than do the native plant species. Furthermore, invasive pests that kill native plants lead to erosion from a loss of vegetative cover.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Invasive Species: Degraded plant health due to eroded soils increases plant susceptibility to invasions. Exposed soil is available to invasive seeds. Some plants planted for soil erosion control are invasive themselves."
Invasives,StormWater,0.775,"The effect of Invasive Species on Stormwater Management: While some invasive vegetation has filtration and absorption capabilities, the majority of invasive plants are less adept at stormwater mitigation than are native plant species.        The effect of Stormwater Management on Invasive Species: Stormwater dispersed seeds and propagules, moving invasives from one location to another. Stormwater can create favorable conditions for certain invasives to flourish (e.g. Phragmites). "
Invasives,Transportation,0.6125,"The effect of Invasive Species on Transportation: The threat of invasives does alter transportation systems in certain ways. A primary effect is that boats, cars, and trains, may need to be inspected for invasive seeds or larvae before taking off.        The effect of Transportation on Invasive Species: Transportation is often times a vector for invasive species, as invasive organisms, seeds, and propagules latch on to boots, boats, or cars."
Invasives,TreeManagement,0.95,"The effect of Invasive Species on Tree Management: Invasive plants and pests have the potential to outcompete and degrade trees planted in urban forests.       The effect of Tree Management on Invasive Species: Urban forests can create habitat for invasives to work their way into. Urban forestry sometimes involves actually planting invasive species as urban plants, which often time come from plant nurseries. Sometimes, urban forestry involves invasive species management and removal. "
Invasives,VulnerableComms,0.275,"The effect of Invasive Species on Vulnerable Communities: Although invasive species generally degrade habitat quality, they can sometimes provide nature access for vulnerable populations.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Invasive Species: The lack of resources and time for the management of invasive species in vulnerable communities leads to their persistence, especially near abandoned sites and railways."
Invasives,WarmSeason,0.5375,"The effect of Invasive Species on Warm Season: Tree and vegetation loss from invasive pressures leads to the loss of a carbon sink.       The effect of Warm Season on Invasive Species: The changing warm season climatic patterns creates conditions conducive for the spread and success of invasives in new regions. Although invasives largely enter a new region due to human movement, they are increasingly surviving and thriving due to more suitable and warmer environments. "
Invasives,WaterQuality,0.575,"The effect of Invasive Species on Water Quality: By and large, invasive plants, fish, and pests have myriad effects on water quality. Invasive zebra mussels improve watr quality. Certain invasive plants are better or worse at stormwater filtration, which impacts water quality.        The effect of Water Quality on Invasive Species: Degraded water quality might allow for generalist aquatic invasive species to thrive and outcompete sensitive native species. This has little effect on invasive terrestrial species."
LandUse,Nutrients,0.6,"The effect of Land Use on Nutrient Management: Agricultural land uses have major impacts on nutrients by inputting them into watersheds. Nutrient management plans are a part of land use planning.       The effect of Nutrient Management on Land Use: Nutrient availability has a major impact on agricultural possibilities, but has less impact on urban land uses."
LandUse,PestsPath,0.5,"The effect of Land Use on Pests and Pathogensogens: The more a landscape is developed and degraded, the less resilient it is to pest/pathogen invasions, largely because land use lowers plant diversity.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Land Use: Landscaping and agriculture are the two main types of land uses that are majorly impacted by pests and pathogens. Pest and pathogen management plans are often implemented; some agricultural sites may be abandoned due to pest pressure."
LandUse,Recreation,0.7625,"The effect of Land Use on Recreation and Green Space: Depending on the land use type, it can prompt integrated or disintegrated green space areas by creating opportunities for recreational spaces.        The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Land Use: Land near green spaces may become more valuable and attractive. Green space areas have impacts on land use possibilities, as they are less likely to be converted to development."
LandUse,RestorNatSyst,0.725,The effect of Land Use on Restoration: Land use legacies impact restoration possibilities by changing the landscape and valuation of the land. These changes to the landscape can either make restoration more difficult or even more of a necessitiy.       The effect of Restoration on Land Use: Restored sites make adjacent lands more desirable and valuable. Restoration is often interlinked with land uses in cases of conservation easements. It is difficult to be able to develop in areas adjacent to restoration sites.
LandUse,RisingTemps,0.4,"The effect of Land Use on Rising Temperatures: A substantial amount of carbon emissions come from land use change. Increased impervious surface cover and less vegetation leads to more heat reflection and less shading. Overall, these impacts lead to the global phenomenon of rising temperatures and lead to warmer microclimates, including the urban heat island effect.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Land Use: Rising temperatures influence the sustainability and growth of agro-ecosystems and croplands. Temperature rise might cause some developers to focus more on building designs and materials for cooling purposes."
LandUse,SoilErosion,0.8,"The effect of Land Use on Soil Erosion: Anytime soil is disturbed or moved from land use it is opened up to being eroded. All land uses lead to erosion of some sort.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Land Use: Soil erosion is something that is mandated to be considered during land use or transportation projects, especially when the project occurs near waterways. "
LandUse,StormWater,0.825,"The effect of Land Use on Stormwater Management: Land use directly changes landscapes and the hydrology of a watershed. Invariable, these changes to the landscape will impact the way in which stormwater travels over the land. Stormwater will become flashier and faster.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Land Use: Stormwater regimes impact the viability of a land for certain land use types. Stormwater management is essential for land use planning, also making it more expensive."
LandUse,Transportation,0.925,The effect of Land Use on Transportation: Land uses necessitate transportation for access. Existing land uses dictate where and how transportation infrastructure is planned and implemented.        The effect of Transportation on Land Use: Existing transportation infrastructure guide land use planning and land valuations. Transit-oriented development means that development follows transit opportunities.
LandUse,TreeManagement,0.7,The effect of Land Use on Tree Management: Urban developers include arborists in the planning process in order to establish an ubran tree canopy.       The effect of Tree Management on Land Use: Urban forests improve the value of urban lands through heat reduction and greenery. The provision of urban trees may be included in land use decision making. 
LandUse,VulnerableComms,0.5125,"The effect of Land Use on Vulnerable Communities: Gentrification as a modern-day land use technique directly impacts the health and food security of the most vulnerable populations, who are disproportionately minorities that live in congested areas that lack access to certain commodities.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Land Use: Resource-poor vulnerable communities lack control (a voice) in land use planning. The existence of a vulnerable community in an area may alter development planning (to move away from it), or can require land use planning to consider the vulnerable population by, for instance, implementing public transportation options."
LandUse,WarmSeason,0.575,"The effect of Land Use on Warm Season: Urban land uses have negative microclimate effects mostly, but do contribute to the changing climate globally due to concentrated emissions.       The effect of Warm Season on Land Use: New precipitation and seasonality regimes definitely impact land use planning, as land use planners must build infrastructure that can be resilient to precipitation and temperature extremes. The changign warm season climate has a major impact on the viability of some agricultural land uses."
LandUse,WaterQuality,0.75,"The effect of Land Use on Water Quality: Land use has a major impact on water qualtiy, whether it is from agriculture, industry, urban, or residential development. In all types of land uses, pollutants and eroded soil is likely to enter and pollute waterways.       The effect of Water Quality on Land Use: Water quality issues, or even the presence of pristine water quality, might force people to be more or less conscious of how they affect waterways based on their land uses. "
Nutrients,PestsPath,0.3775,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Pests and Pathogensogens: Because nutrient cycling is critical for plant health, and plant health is critical in plant ability to defend against pests and pathogens, nutrient levels have an indirect impact on pest and pathogen invasions.       The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Nutrient Management: Pests and pathogens can impact nutrients in two main ways. First, insect pests that defoliate trees convert plant biomass into available nutrients, which can run out of an ecosystem. Second, pests that decimate tree populations allow for increased runoff speed and increased soil erosion, which facilitates nutrient runoff."
Nutrients,Recreation,0.6375,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Recreation and Green Space: Nutrients (fertilizers) can be applied to green spaces to promote healthy vegetation. In excess, nutrients can worsen water quality in recreational areas, which worsens the green space.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Nutrient Management: Green space areas have the ability to filter nutrient runoff, but the degree to which this actually has a noticeable impact depends on whether the green space is located downhill of nutrient input sites. Green space managers can purchase abandoned agricultural fields to convert them into green spaces."
Nutrients,RestorNatSyst,0.575,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Restoration: Nutrient issues may be a reason to deploy restoration projects, including wetland and prairies. Furthermore, nutrients that enter restoration sites drive the rate of succession in the restored site and can therefore enhance or worsen the resilience of the site.       The effect of Restoration on Nutrient Management: If a goal of a restoration activity is to improve water quality, it will deliberately attempt to slow nutrient runoff. Restored drainage networks reduce nutrient loading. The scale of the restoration project has much to do with its ability to have a noticeable effect on nutrients."
Nutrients,RisingTemps,0.2875,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Rising Temperatures: Indirectly, nutrients encourage plant growth and plant growth helps to sequester carbon.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Nutrient Management: Warmer temperatures speed up nutrient cycling as organic matter breaks down quicker and inorganic nutrient products become available. Nutrient timing and uptake is therefore impacted."
Nutrients,SoilErosion,0.8375,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Soil Erosion: Adequate nutrients are required for plant growth which is what stabilizes soil erosion.        The effect of Soil Erosion on Nutrient Management: As soils become eroded, they take nutrients along with them. Areas with eroded soils have altered nutrient management plans. "
Nutrients,StormWater,0.7,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Stormwater Management: Regions with nutrient issues might require altered stormwater management plans. Nutrients themselves though have only a minor impact on stormwater, in that nutrients encourage plant growth which slows surface runoff.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Nutrient Management: Stormwater has a major impact on nutrients as runoff carries nutrients along with it. On ag fields, nutrient loss has more to do with rainfall falling on soils than with stormwater passing through the agricultural site."
Nutrients,Transportation,0.2125,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Transportation: In extreme cases, nutrients can hamper aquatic transportation in cases of HABs.       The effect of Transportation on Nutrient Management: Certain transportation maintenance activities might require nutrients, to a small degree."

The effect of Tree Management on Nutrient Management: While urban trees and forests do uptake nutrients, they have only a small importance due to the fact that they do not occur near areas with high nutrient runoff. "
Nutrients,VulnerableComms,0.625,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Vulnerable Communities: Vulnerable populations who have degraded infrastructure and poor wastewater treatment centers are highly susceptible to nutrient-related water quality problems. Additionally, nutrient-rich foods are less available to vulnerable populations, who rely more heavily on processed foods.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Nutrient Management: Vulnerable populations may lack the ability to treat excess nutrients because they could lack wastewater treatment plants. Farmers who are considered to be vulnerable populations utilize nutrient applications for crop production."
Nutrients,WarmSeason,0.5375,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Warm Season: Because nutrients encourage plant growth, they are useful in the sequestration of carbon to an extent.       The effect of Warm Season on Nutrient Management: Changing daytime and nighttime temperatures impact the uptake of nutrients by plants. High intensity precipitation events lead to nutrient loss on agricultural sites. These changing conditions affect the timing and amount of nutrient applications that are necessary."
Nutrients,WaterQuality,0.775,"The effect of Nutrient Management on Water Quality: Nutrients have an outstanding impact on water quality as they directly play into aquatic ecological conditions, cause harmful algal blooms, and eutrophy water bodies.       The effect of Water Quality on Nutrient Management: Motivation for improved water quality can lead to more efficient nutrient management and application strategies. Low oxygen events in water bodies (e.g. hypoxia) can cause the remineralization of phosphorus into the water column, feeding into nutrient cycling. This causes increased nutrient loading. "
PestsPath,Recreation,0.8625,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Recreation and Green Space: Pests and pathogens pose major problems for green space managers, as they negatively impact green spaces by killing vegetation. If large components of a green space are compromised, then the green space is much less enjoyable for recreation.       The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Pests and Pathogensogens: People in parks have been known to transport pests and pathogens with firewood or zebra mussels with boats. A major component of green space management is usually the fight against pests and pathogens."
PestsPath,RestorNatSyst,0.65,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Restoration: Often times, the presence of invasive pests and pathogens might be a driver to restore a system back to its natural function and remove the pressure. Pests and pathogens  pose a threat to the restoration process itself, though, by slowing down progress and introducing an additional layer of complexity to the project.       The effect of Restoration on Pests and Pathogensogens: Restored sites done correctly can limit pests and pathogens by decreasing susceptibility of the native plants and species, typically done by improving biodiversity."
PestsPath,RisingTemps,0.6,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Rising Temperatures: The reduction of greenery from pests and pathogens leads to a pulse of carbon being released into the atmosphere and the loss of a carbon sink. There is also the loss of microclimate shading benefits from the trees that are killed by pests and pathogens.       The effect of Rising Temperatures on Pests and Pathogensogens: Rising temperatures change the range at which pests and pathogens can thrive in addition to altering the growth rate of host species for pests and pathogens. Increasing temperatures importantly can allow for pests and pathogens to survive over the winter, allowing them to spread farther. Also, pests and pathogens have more life cycles per year in warmer conditions, allowing them to spread farther."
PestsPath,SoilErosion,0.2875,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Soil Erosion: Indirectly, as pests and pathogens weaken or kill vegetation, erosion rates are enhanced as a lower canopy cover allows more rainfall to reach the ground and less plant roots to stabilize the soil.       The effect of Soil Erosion on Pests and Pathogensogens: Reduced plant growth due to soil erosion removes some hosts for pests and pathogens. Weakened plants due to soil erosion are more susceptible to pests and pathogens."
PestsPath,StormWater,0.3125,The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Stormwater Management: Tree loss from pest and pathogen pressure means poor stormwater control and absrobtion.       The effect of Stormwater Management on Pests and Pathogensogens: Stormwater can spread pests and water-borne pathogens. Stormwater that degrades tree health renders vegetation more susceptible to pest and pathogen invasions.
PestsPath,Transportation,0.525,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Transportation: Pests and pathogens will only impact the transportation system if measures are taken to limit the spread of the pest or pathogen. Examples of human measures include reducing travel overall (COVID-19), inspections of vehicles for invasive pests.       The effect of Transportation on Pests and Pathogensogens: Transportation emissions contribute to the changing climate, which creates high pests and pathogen pressures. More importantly, transportation facilitates the movement and introduction of invasive pests and pathogens."
PestsPath,TreeManagement,0.95,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Tree Management: Pest and pathogen problems have dramatic effects on urban foretry especially because they are often less biodiverse (more susceptible to invasion) than are natural systems.       The effect of Tree Management on Pests and Pathogensogens: Urban trees are typically planted in stressful conditions which makes them more susceptible to pest and pathogens. Therefore, urban forests can serve as resevoirs or bridges for invasions."
PestsPath,VulnerableComms,0.6,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Vulnerable Communities: Vulnerable commumnities who are already stressed are disproportionately impacted by pest and pathogens. This is because they have fewer resources to fight against pest and pathogen pressures and poor access to health care in cases of disease transmission.       The effect of Vulnerable Communities on Pests and Pathogensogens: Because vulnerable populations lack resources to manage pests and pathogen outbreaks, they do have an impact on the spread of pests and pathogens."
PestsPath,WarmSeason,0.475,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Warm Season: Lost greenery due to pest and pathogen pressure has a small impact on the global phenomenon of the changing warm season climate.       The effect of Warm Season on Pests and Pathogensogens: The warming of the warm season and warming of overnight low temperatures allows for the fuerther expanmsion of pests. More water vapor in the atmosphere creates more rainfall, which leads to pathogen spread. Tropical diseases are able to penetrate further North. Warming winters reduces the amount of winter kill of pests. Longer growing seasons allows for pests to have more life cycles in a year. All of these effects lead to heightened pest and pathogen pressures."
PestsPath,WaterQuality,0.7,"The effect of Pests and Pathogensogens on Water Quality: Biological invasions impact the biological quality of the water. Tree loss due to pests and pathogens increases runoff issues, increasing the amount of pollutants that enter into waterways and damage chemical water quality. Tree mortality also alters water temperature from the loss of shading in riparian areas, which affects the physical quality of water.       The effect of Water Quality on Pests and Pathogensogens: Poor water quality supports pests and pathogen spread. Pollutants and sewage can be a vector for pathogens. "
Recreation,RestorNatSyst,0.775,The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Restoration: Green space areas provide immense opportunities for restoration initiatives.

Recreation,WarmSeason,0.575,"The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Warm Season: Green space areas can sequester carbon and mitigate the changing warm season - slightly. The action of recreating in green spaces might improve environmental and climate awareness. The action of recreating in green spaces often times requires driving to the green space, which leads to carbon emissions.       The effect of Warm Season on Recreation and Green Space: A longer and warmer warm season means that people will seek out more recreation opportunities. Extreme heat can limit recreation. Water quality issues caused by warm season changes can keep people away. The changing warm season alters the growing season, species composition, and phenological patterns of the green space itself."
Recreation,WaterQuality,0.825,"The effect of Recreation and Green Space on Water Quality: Green space areas that are properly planned and managed filter out pollutants before they can enter streams. The people who recreate in green space areas might cause or directly pollute streams, though.

"
RestorNatSyst,Transportation,0.4625,"The effect of Restoration on Transportation: Restoration sites impact where roads or railways can exist. Restored areas become a destination, causing roads to be built so that people can access the restored site.       The effect of Transportation on Restoration: Transportation agencies that destroy land for infrastructure are sometimes required to buy into compensatory mitigation projects in which they buy into restoration projects elsewhere. Transportation infrastructure limits the viability and success of restoration projects, or could present an opportunity for restoration."
RestorNatSyst,TreeManagement,0.75,"The effect of Restoration on Tree Management: Restored sites improve the tree canopy and call for urban foresters or arborists to be involved in the restoration process.

In some situations, leaders may arise in a vulnerable community to bring people together to clean up an environmental problem."
RestorNatSyst,WarmSeason,0.5875,The effect of Restoration on Warm Season: The conversion for example of a parking lot to a praire goes a long way for sequestration and heat mitigation. Restored sites are more resilient to the changing warm season.       The effect of Warm Season on Restoration: Increases in precipitation extremes can make restoration much more difficult. Droughts after seedings can wreck resoration efforts. The changing warm season climate is something that may spur restoration projects and is definitely a factor that must be considered when undergoing restoration projects.
RestorNatSyst,WaterQuality,0.875,The effect of Restoration on Water Quality: Restoration greatly improves water quality by filtering pollutants and stabilizing soils.       The effect of Water Quality on Restoration: Poor water quality is often times a driver for restoration.
